## Tooling

- We use `pnpm` as our package manager - [Documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Do NOT use another package manager
- Clone your repo to the Linux system (Windows only)
- Make sure to have `foramtOnSave` on and `prettier` as your default formatter in VSCode, or run `pnpm format` before you commit your code (This will make your life a lot easier - less merge conflicts)
